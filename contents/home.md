Hello! I am Shriniwas Kulkarni
I will be doing my Master's in CS from UCSD starting Sept. 2024. 
Currently working full time as an SDE at Oracle (OCI)

I like to explore, and have explored, areas which are distant from each other, gain insights from one and try to apply them to the others.
I am particularly interested in Computer Vision, Image Processing, Algorithms, Game Theory, AI. While doing my job as an SDE, I have developed an interest in automating manual things. I try to enforce it as much as I can as a Software Engineer, and find it very useful in the long run for your projects.
Find my Git at the bottom if Interested!
